# Logisim-Computer
301 Project of Logisim Computer taking in 32 bit MIPS instructions

C++ File is to compile MIPS assembly code to make it 32 bit machine code for the Logisim computer to read. After inputting the machine code into the ROM in the computer, the computer in simulation mode will process the basic machine code and complete those operations. A kernal can be attached to handle syscalls if needed.
